# The Linux File System Structure
Linux uses a hierarchical (tree) structure starting from the root directory /. Unlike Windows which uses drive letters (C:, D:), Linux has a single unified tree.

```bash
/                   # Root directory
├── /bin           # Essential user binaries
├── /boot          # Boot loader files
├── /dev           # Device files
├── /etc           # System configuration file ⚠️ 
├── /home          # User home directories
├── /lib           # Essential libraries
├── /media         # Removable media mount points
├── /mnt           # Temporary mount points
├── /opt           # Optional software
├── /proc          # Process information (virtual)
├── /root          # Root user home
├── /sbin          # System binaries
├── /srv           # Service data
├── /sys           # Kernel and system info (virtual)
├── /tmp           # Temporary files ⚠️ Often writable
├── /usr           # User programs
├── /var           # Variable data (logs, mail, etc.)
```

# / (root)
The top of everything. Every folder starts from here.

- Hierarchical structure starting from / (root)
- Everything in Linux is treated as a file
- Directories, devices, sockets, processes are all files
- Case-sensitive naming

```
cd /
ls
```

```
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  root  tmp  usr  var
```


## 1) /home
Where user files live.
This is where normal users keep their personal files.

**Example:**
- /home/username/Documents
- /home/username/Downloads

## 2) /root
Home folder for the root user (admin).
A private Folder For Admin.

==where / = Its a directory(folder storing file)==
example:  **/root/etc** 
Linux use **Absolute path** that's why it use (/) in every directory 

## 3) ==/etc==
It store **System configuration files**.
**/etc** is the folder where Linux keeps its settings and rules.

**It stores configuration files that tell the system:**

- Who can log in
- What password rules to use
- How network works
- Which services should start
- Who has admin (sudo) access

**So basically:**
 /etc = Linux control center for system settings
 
**Examples:**
- /etc/passwd      (user account Info)
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config     (ssh server config)
- /etc/hosts     (local host mapping)

## 4) /bin and /usr/bin
- Essential commands and programs needed by User and System
- Essential user binaries

#### ==**/bin**== → Contains basic system commands needed for Linux to run.
**Examples:**
- ls
- cat
- bash
- python3

#### ==**/usr/bin**== → Contains most of the user-level programs and applications.

**Examples:**
- nmap
- curl
- wget
- python

## 5) /sbin and /usr/sbin
Contain important system **Admin**/system commands.

##### ==**/sbin**== → Contains important system administration commands.
Contains essential system management commands needed for booting and repairing the system.

**Examples:**
- reboot
- shutdown
- fdisk
- fsck
- iptables

#### ==/usr/sbin== -> Contains more advanced admin and service-related programs.

**Contains:**
- Service management tools
- Network service binaries
- Server-related programs

**Examples:**
- sshd
- apache2
- nginx
- useradd
- adduser


## ==***6) /var  (is the folder where Linux stores changing data.)***==
“Variable” data (logs, cache, changing stuff)

**Examples:**
- /var/log/auth.log
- /var/log/syslog

#### ==**/var/log**==
**Common log files:**
- /var/log/auth.log → Login attempts (Debian/Ubuntu)
- /var/log/secure → Login logs (RHEL/CentOS)
- /var/log/syslog → General system logs
- /var/log/messages → System messages
- /var/log/apache2/ → Web server logs
- /var/log/nginx/ → Web server logs

#### **/var/lib**
- Application state data
- Databases
- Package information

#### **/var/cache**
Cached files from applications


## 7) /tmp
- /tmp is a directory used to store temporary files created by programs.
- Temporary files (often cleared on reboot)/Often writable
- ==every user can work in this directory==

#### ==**/var/tmp**==
- Temporary files
- Similar to /tmp
- Files may persist after reboot ==(the file will still be there even after you restart the system.)==


## 8) /dev
- Contains device files—these represent hardware and virtual devices as files.
- Devices treated like files / Device files

**Examples:**
- /dev/sda (disk)
- /dev/null
- /dev/tty

### /mnt 
- Used as a temporary mount point.
- Admins often mount disks here manually.

**Example:**
```Bash
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
```

### /run/media
Where drives get mounted (USB, external disks)
Used for removable media **Automatically**

**Examples:**

- USB drives
- DVD/CD



## 9) /boot
This contains files needed to start Linux.

**Examples:**

- kernel files
- initramfs
- bootloader-related files

Without this, **system booting is affected.**


## 10) /proc
- /proc is a virtual filesystem that provides real-time information about the system and running processes.
- Virtual filesystem showing running system info.
- It Does not store normal files like Document.

**It gives info about:-**
- Running process
- Kernel
- Memory
- CPU

**Examples:**
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo
cat /proc/meminfo
```

## 11) /opt 
- Used for **optional** or **third party software**.
- /opt is used to store optional or third-party software packages that are not part of the default system.
- If you install Some extra Application manually, it may go here.

**Examples:**
- /opt/google/ → Google Chrome
- /opt/lampp/ → XAMPP
## 12) /run
`/run` is a directory that stores temporary runtime data created by the system while it is running.

- Stores runtime info 
- current running system data 

**What it contains**
- Process IDs (PID files)
- System state info
- Service runtime data

**Examples:**
- /run/sshd.pid → SSH service process ID
- /run/systemd/ → system manager data




### Absolute vs Relative Paths
#### Absolute Path
- Starts from root /
- Complete path to file/directory
- Works from anywhere

```
/home/john/documents/report.txt
/etc/passwd
/var/log/secure
```

#### Relative Path
- Relative to current directory
- Does not start with /
- Shorter but depends on location

```
documents/report.txt      # From /home/john
../jane/file.txt          # Go up one, then to jane
./script.sh               # Current directory
```

#### Special Directory References
| Symbol  | Meaning             |
| :------ | :------------------ |
| `.`     | Current directory   |
| `..`    | Parent directory    |
| `~`     | Home directory      |
| `~user` | Another user's home |

# Specify Files by Name
**File Naming Rules:**
- Case-sensitive (File.txt ≠ file.txt)
- Can contain letters, numbers, dots, underscores, hyphens
- Avoid spaces (use quotes or escape if needed)
- **Hidden files start with .**
- No length limit practically (255 characters max)
- Avoid special characters (/ \ * ? " < > |)

### Hidden Files
Files starting with . are hidden by default.
```
ls          # Shows only visible files
ls -a       # Shows all files including hidden
ls -la      # Long listing with hidden files
```

#### Important Directories

| File/Directory           | Description                    |     |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------- | --- |
| `~/.bash_history`        | Command history                |     |
| `~/.bashrc`              | Bash configuration             |     |
| `~/.bash_profile`        | Login configuration            |     |
| `~/.ssh/`                | SSH keys and config            |     |
| `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` | Allowed SSH public keys        |     |
| `~/.ssh/id_rsa`          | Private SSH key (**CRITICAL**) |     |
| `~/.ssh/known_hosts`     | Known SSH servers              |     |
| `~/.config/`             | Application configs            |     |
==`~/.bashrc` - It's a file run in background when we open terminal & configure the terminal according to our alias or predefined alias.==

**View file:**
```bash
 cat ~/.bash_history
```

**Edit file:**
```Bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

# Manage Files with Command-line Tools

## Listing Files - ls Command
```
ls                  # List current directory

ls -a               # Show hidden files
ls -la              # Long format with hidden
ls -lh              # Human-readable sizes
ls -lt              # Sort by modification time
ls -lS              # Sort by size
ls -R               # Recursive listing
ls -ld /etc         # Directory info only
```

### Understanding long format output:
```
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2388 Jan 15 10:30 passwd
```

| Field          | Meaning                     |
| :------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `-rw-r--r--`   | Permissions (Type + Access) |
| `.`            | SELinux context indicator   |
| `1`            | Number of hard links        |
| `root`         | Owner (User)                |
| `root`         | Group                       |
| `2388`         | Size in bytes               |
| `Jan 15 10:30` | Last modification time      |
| `passwd`       | File name                   |

## Creating Directories - mkdir Command

touch file1 file2 file3         # Create multiple files
touch -t 202301151030 file.txt  # Set specific timestamp
```

==**Note:** touch also updates timestamps of existing files.==

## Copying Files - cp Command
```
cp source destination           # Basic copy
cp file.txt /tmp/               # Copy to directory
cp file.txt /tmp/newname.txt    # Copy with new name
cp -r dir1 dir2                 # Copy directory recursively
cp -p file.txt backup/          # Preserve permissions and timestamps
cp -i file.txt /tmp/            # Interactive (prompt before overwrite)
cp -v file.txt /tmp/            # Verbose output
cp -a source/ dest/             # Archive mode (preserves everything)
```

## Moving and Renaming - mv Command
```
mv oldname newname              # Rename file
mv file.txt /tmp/               # Move to directory

___ 

# The find Command
Powerful command for searching files.

**Basic syntax:**
```
find [path] [options] [expression]
```

```bash
find / -name passwd                     # Find by name
find / -iname passwd                    # Case-insensitive
find / -name "*.conf"                   # Wildcard search
find /home -user john                   # Files owned by user
find / -group admin                     # Files owned by group
find / -type f                          # Files only
find / -type d                          # Directories only
find / -type l                          # Symbolic links
find / -size +10M                       # Files larger than 10MB
find / -size -1k                        # Files smaller than 1KB
find / -mtime -7                        # Modified in last 7 days
find / -atime +30                       # Accessed more than 30 days ago
find / -perm 777                        # Exact permissions
find / -perm -4000                      # SUID files
find / -perm -2000                      # SGID files
find / -writable                        # Writable by current user
find / -executable                      # Executable by current user
```

# The locate Command
Faster than find but uses a database.

```bash
locate passwd                   # Find files containing "passwd"
locate -i readme                # Case-insensitive
locate -c "*.conf"              # Count matches
updatedb                        # Update database (root required)
```


#  `which` (Command path finder)
Finds the path of executable commands
- Searches in $PATH only
- Works only for commands

**example:**
```
which ls
```

**output:**
```
/bin/ls
```

``` bash
which python                    # Find command location
which -a python                 # All locations in PATH
```

#  `whereis` (Quick binary/manuals + info)

Finds binary, source, and manual pages
- Faster than find
- Not as deep as find
**example:**
```
whereis ls
```

**output:**
```
ls: /bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz
```

```
whereis python3
```

| Command   | Search Type      | Speed     | Accuracy  | Use Case          |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| `find`    | Real filesystem  | Slow      | Very high | Deep search       |
| `locate`  | Database         | Fast      | Medium    | Quick search      |
| `which`   | Executables only | Very fast | High      | Find command path |
| `whereis` | Binary + docs    | Fast      | Medium    | Quick lookup      |

# `grep` = Global Regular Expression Print

**grep** = **search text inside files and output**
==It searches for patterns (text) inside files or command output.==
`grep` is one of the most powerful **text-search** tools in Linux—used everywhere from basic file searches to advanced cybersecurity analysis.

**Basic Syntax:**
```
grep [options] pattern file
```

```
grep "error" logfile.txt                        (Shows lines containing error)
grep "error" file1.txt file2.txt                (Search in Multiple Files)
grep -r "password" /etc                         (Searches all files inside /etc)  (Recursive Search)   
ps aux | grep nginx                             (Finds running nginx processes)

grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log        (Find failed logins)
```
