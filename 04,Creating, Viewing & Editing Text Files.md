# Redirect Output to a File or Program
### Output?
When you run a command, it shows results on screen. This is called output.

```bash
ls
```
Output appears on your screen.

## Two Types of Output

Type	                   Name	                           File Descriptor	                Description
___
stdout	                   Standard Output	             1	                                Normal output/results
_________________________________________
stderr	                   Standard Error	                 2	                                Error messages
_________________________________________
stdin                       Standard Input                   0                                 Input 


## 1. Standard Output #stdout - File Descriptor `1`

- What it is: Normal output from a command
- Where it goes: Your screen by default
**
Example:**
```bash
ls          # Lists files - this output is stdout
echo "Hi"  # Prints "Hi" - this is stdout
```
## 2. Standard Error #stderr - File Descriptor `2`

- What it is: Error messages
- Where it goes: Your screen by default (but separate from stdout)

**Example:**
```bash
ls /fake/folder   # Error message "No such file" is stderr
cat wrongfile.txt # Error goes to stderr
```

## 3. Standard Input #stdin - File Descriptor `0`

- What it is: Input TO a command (not output, but related)
- Where it comes from: Your keyboard by default

**Example:**
```bash
cat           # Waits for you to type (stdin)
read name     # Takes input from user
```

# Save Output to a File 

### Create New File or #Overwrite (>)

- Redirects output to a file by replacing its existing contents
- If the file doesn’t exist → it gets created
- If it exists → everything inside is deleted first

**Example:**
```bash
echo "Hello" > file.txt
```
**file.txt** will contain only:
```
Hello
```
**Warning: Using > will delete old content!**


```bash
ls > myfiles.txt
```
This saves the file list into myfiles.txt



### Add to Existing File / #Append (>>)

- Redirects output to a file by adding to the end
- If the file doesn’t exist → it gets created
- If it exists → new content is added after existing content

**Example:**
```
echo "World" >> file.txt
```

**file.txt becomes:**
```
Hello
World
```

```bash
echo "Line 1" > notes.txt       # Creates file
echo "Line 2" >> notes.txt      # Adds to file
echo "Line 3" >> notes.txt      # Adds more
```

Now notes.txt has 3 lines.


## `2>` (Redirect Errors Only)

2> redirects stderr (error output only) to a file

**example:**
```bash
ls file.txt wrongfile 2> error.txt
```
- file.txt output → screen
- Error (wrongfile) → error.txt

## `&>` (Redirect Everything)

&> redirects both stdout + stderr into one file

**example:**
```
ls file.txt wrongfile &> output.txt
```
- Normal output → file
- Error output → same file

## `tee` (Output to Screen + File)

tee reads input and sends it to:
- screen (stdout)
- file (simultaneously)

**example:**
```bash
ls | tee output.txt
```
- Shows output
- Saves output

```
ls | tee -a output.txt   (append)
```
Adds to file instead of overwriting.

# Edit Text Files from the Shell Prompt

**Two Main Editors:**

| Editor   | Difficulty | Best For       |
| :------- | :--------- | :------------- |
| **nano** | Easy       | Beginners      |
| **vim**  | Hard       | Advanced users |


## Vim [[07.1 Vim - Software Management - SSH]]

## #Nano Text Editor

Open a File
```bash
nano filename.txt
```

**Basic command:**

| Action         | Keys to press             |
| :------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Save file**  | `Ctrl` + `O` then `Enter` |
| **Exit**       | `Ctrl` + `X`              |
| **Cut line**   | `Ctrl` + `K`              |
| **Paste**      | `Ctrl` + `U`              |
| **Search**     | `Ctrl` + `W`              |
| **Go to line** | `Ctrl` + `_`              |


## Create File Without Editor
Create File Without Editor

#### Create small file:
```
echo "Hello World" > myfile.txt
```

#### Create file with multiple lines:
```
cat > notes.txt << EOF
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
EOF
```

## Stream Editors (sed & awk)

**Difference from nano/vim:**
- nano/vim: Open file, edit interactively, save
- sed/awk: Edit text in one command (non-interactive)


### #awk (Pattern Scanning & Processing)
- `awk` is a pattern scanning and processing tool, mainly used for structured data (columns/fields).
- ==awk is a tool to work with columns in text files.==

**AWK is best for:**
- printing specific columns
- filtering based on conditions
- parsing logs, /etc/passwd, command output

**If a file looks like:**
```
xyz 25 india
john 30 usa
```

**command:**
```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
```

**output:**
```
ak
john
```

**How AWK sees data**
By default, AWK splits each line by spaces/tabs into fields:
- $1 = first column
- $2 = second column
- $NF = last column
- NR = line number

**Example:**
```bash
echo "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" | awk -F: '{print $1, $7}'
```

**Output:**
```bash
root /bin/bash
```

#### AWK basic format
```bash
awk 'pattern { action }' file
```

**example:**
```bash
awk '$3 > 1000 {print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd
```
**Meaning:**
- if column 3 (UID) > 1000
- print username + UID


### #sed (Stream Editor) (search/replace + line editing)

`sed` is used to edit and transform text streams (line by line).

**Purpose:** Find/replace + delete/insert for text streams

==sed is used to find and replace text.==

**SED is best for:**
- replacing text
- deleting lines
- printing specific lines
- quick cleanup (spaces, blank lines)
- editing in pipelines

#### Sed basic format
```bash
sed 'command' file
```

**example:**
```bash
sed 's/india/USA/g' file.txt
```
It replaces india with USA.

**example:**
```
echo "hello root" | sed 's/root/admin/'
```

**output:**
```bash
hello admin
```

**example:**
```bash
# Replace all "http" with "https"
sed 's/http/https/g' urls.txt
```

# Change the Shell Environment
## Environment Variables #env
Variables are like containers that store information.

The system uses variables to remember things like:
- Your username
- Your home folder
- Where to find commands

### View Variables
**See one variable:**
```
echo $HOME
echo $USER
echo $SHELL
```

==**See all variables:**==
```
env
```

#### Important Variables

| Variable | What it stores           | Example Value     |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :---------------- |
| `$HOME`  | Your home folder         | `/home/john`      |
| `$USER`  | Your username            | `john`            |
| `$SHELL` | Your shell program       | `/bin/bash`       |
| `$PWD`   | Current folder           | `/home/john/docs` |
| `$PATH`  | Where commands are found | `/usr/bin:/bin`   |
### Create Your Own Variable
```
MYNAME="ak"
echo $MYNAME
```

output:ak

## The PATH Variable 
PATH tells the system where to look for commands.

```
echo $PATH
```


**Output looks like:**
```
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

These are folders separated by :

### Add Folder to PATH
```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/john/scripts
```
Now system will also look in /home/john/scripts for commands.


#### ==Check for passwords in environment:==
```
env | grep -i pass
env | grep -i key
```

## #Aliases - Create Shortcuts
Tired of typing long commands? Create shortcuts!

**Create alias:**
```
alias ll='ls -la'
```


```
alias c='clear'
alias h='history'
alias ports='ss -tulnp'
```

#### See all aliases:
```
alias
```

####
```
unalias ll
```


## Make Changes Permanent #bashrc
Changes disappear when you close terminal!

To keep them forever, add to ~/.bashrc:
```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

**Add your lines at the bottom:**
```
alias ll='ls -la'
alias c='clear'
export PATH=$PATH:/home/john/scripts
```
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+X)

**Apply changes now:**
```
source ~/.bashrc
```



_________________________________________________



## Command History
Bash remembers your old commands.

**View history:**
```
history
```

**Run old command:**
```
!50                             # Run command number 50
!!                              # Run last command
```


**Clear history:**
```
history -c
```

# Make Links Between Files

## 1) Symbolic Link (Soft Link)

A symbolic link is like a shortcut.

**example:**
```
ln -s file1.txt softlink.txt
```

**Check:**
```
ls -l
```
#### Key points

- It stores the path of the original file
- If the original file is deleted → the symlink becomes broken
- Works for files and directories

## 2) Hard Link

A hard link is like giving the same file another name.

**Example:**
```
ln file1.txt hardlink.txt
```

**Key points:**
**Both filenames point to the same inode (same data)**
**If you delete the original file → hard link still works**
**Usually used only for files (not directories)**
